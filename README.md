+ Project summary: In this project, the datasets that we are going to use describe 5-star ratings from a movie recommendation service. We implemented two methods for collaborative filtering from scratch, namely Gradient Descent with Probabilistic Assumptions (A2) and Alternating Least Squares (A3). Then we have used SVD with Kernel Ridge Regression (P3) for post-processing to improve prediction accuracy. In the end, we compared and summarized the performance of these two methods given the same post-processing method (SVD with KRR).
